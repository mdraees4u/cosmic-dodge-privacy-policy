  <h1>Privacy Policy — Cosmic Dodge</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 23 Feb 2026<br/>
  <strong>Developer:</strong> MH Apps Dev</p>

  <p>Cosmic Dodge (“the App”) is a premium, one-time paid mobile game. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Cosmic Dodge does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
  We do <strong>not</strong> require account registration, and we do <strong>not</strong> request your name, email, phone number, location, or contacts.</p>

  <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>The App may store <strong>game-related data locally on your device</strong> to provide core features, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High score / progress</li>
    <li>Settings (e.g., sound/music/haptics preferences)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data stays on your device and is not sent to us.</p>

  <h2>Ads & Tracking</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No ads</strong> are shown in the App.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use analytics SDKs or tracking technologies.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share data with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>Cosmic Dodge may use device capabilities only to run the game properly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vibration / haptics</strong> (for gameplay feedback)</li>
    <li><strong>Audio output</strong> (sound effects and background music)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not access your files, photos, microphone, camera, or location.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Cosmic Dodge does not integrate third-party advertising or analytics services.
  The App is distributed via <strong>Google Play</strong>, which may process purchase and device information as required to deliver the App and handle billing. Please review Google’s policies for details.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Cosmic Dodge does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will address it.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Because we do not collect or transmit personal data, there is no personal user database. Local game data remains on your device.</p>
